# greenhouse-gas-emissions-analysis

This repo is about exploring the effects of electricity consumption and natural gas consumption on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The dataset used here contains the information about energy consumption and GHG emissions of 1482 sites in the City of Toronto in 2018. I did the exploratory analysis by making some relevant plots and tables, also applied the multiple linear regression model to analyze the effects further. The analysis and paper were created in a fully reproducible way.

**Key findings**
As more amount of electricity and natural gas consumed, the greenhouse gas emissions will increase.
